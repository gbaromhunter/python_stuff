For enabling our python program to have Character recognition capabilities, we would be making
use of pytesseract OCR library. The library could be installed onto our python environment by

executing the following command in the command interpreter of the OS:-Unsupervised learning of unknown fonts: requires only document images
and a corpus of text.

Ability to handle noisy documents: inconsistent inking, spacing, vertical
alignment

Support for multilingual documents, including those that have
considerable word-level code-switching.

Unsupervised learning of orthographic variation patterns including
archaic spellings and printer shorthand.

Simultaneous, joint transcription into both diplomatic (literal) and
normalized forms.
