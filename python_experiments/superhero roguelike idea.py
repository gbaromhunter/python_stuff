# You were a normal, hard working man (more like a lazy npc-like slacker) until one day a friend made you take DMT.
# Now you're wandering around in this everchanging mess of an urban landscape, gobbling radioactive waste,
# getting bitten by radioactive opossums and generally being irradiated in many radioactive ways in order to obtain new
# terrific powers. You decided that you had enough of your old life and now just embraced this chaotic lifestyle
# based on brutal natural selection. Pretty convenient in all of this that you have radioactive superpower!
# anyways you didn't decide your goals yet, but you were thinking about becoming a superhero.
# there are 30 families in crime to beat, in order to clean the town from criminal scum. And you can use deadly force
# without facing trial!
# each family is randomized. they have different racket, enemies, weapons, signature moves, ways of attack. of course
# at the end there is the family boss which is still randomly generated in the flavour of the family
# this is meant to be a fairly traditional roguelike, heavily influenced by cataclysm dda. the focus is on tactical
# combat, randomized powers, loot and equipment, characters etc. the quests are random as well.
# it must be immersive and descriptive as well. with ascii graphics and many descriptions in the log.
# the missions might be of different various types like, , raiding illegal operations of different
# nature, capturing leutenants (minibosses) and sometimes neutral adventures like saving civilians or helping
# in a natural disaster,
